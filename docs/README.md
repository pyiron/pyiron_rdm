# pyiron_rdm

The purpose of pyiron_rdm is to provide parsers to extract additional information from pyiron{_atomistics, _base} jobs and annotate them with semantic information. The result is a JSON-LD or ro-crate describing the data. In addition, it may contain plugins to upload such described data to specific RDM systems like an openBIS instance.
